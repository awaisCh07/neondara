## 3. Detailed Functionality Breakdown

### 3.1. Authentication

The application uses Firebase Authentication for a secure, email-based user system.

- **Sign Up**: New users can create a secure account using their full name, email address, and a password (minimum 6 characters). The system ensures that each email can only be registered once.
- **Log In**: Existing users can log in with their email and password to access their personal ledger. The system provides clear error messages for invalid credentials.
- **Password Reset**: On the login page, a "Forgot Password?" link allows users to enter their email address to receive a password reset link from Firebase.
- **Protected Routes**: All data pages (Ledger, People, etc.) are protected. If a logged-out user tries to access them, they are automatically and seamlessly redirected to the login page.
- **Language Selection**: Users can switch between English and Urdu directly on the login and sign-up screens.

### 3.2. Main Ledger View (`/`)

This is the homepage for authenticated users, providing a comprehensive overview of all Neondara exchanges.

- **Timeline View**: Displays all Neondara entries in a reverse chronological list.
- **Add New Entry**: A prominent "Add Entry" button opens a side sheet to record a new transaction.
- **Entry Details Card**: Each card in the timeline clearly shows:
    - **Direction**: "Given" (with an upward arrow) or "Received" (with a downward arrow).
    - **Person's Name**: The name of the person the transaction was with.
    - **Date and Occasion**: The date of the event and its type (Wedding, Birth, etc.), represented by a unique icon.
    - **Gift Details**:
        - **Money**: Formatted monetary amount (e.g., Rs 1,000).
        - **Sweets**: Quantity in kg and a description (e.g., 2kg Box of mixed sweets).
        - **Gift**: An uploaded image of the gift item, which can be clicked to view a larger version in a dialog. If no image is provided, a text description is shown.
    - **Notes**: Any additional notes are displayed in an italicized blockquote.
- **Edit/Delete Entries**: Each entry card has a "more options" menu (`...`) with "Edit" and "Delete" actions. Deleting an entry requires a confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.
- **Filtering and Search**: A powerful set of controls at the top allows users to refine the timeline:
    - **Search**: A single search bar lets users find entries by matching text in the **person's name**, **gift description**, or **notes**. Matched text is automatically highlighted in the results.
    - **Filter by Person**: A dropdown to show entries for a specific person only.
    - **Filter by Occasion**: A dropdown to filter by Wedding, Birth, Housewarming, or Other.
    - **Filter by Direction**: A dropdown to show only "Given", "Received", or both.
- **Export All Data**: A user menu option to download a CSV of all entries currently displayed (respects applied filters).

### 3.3. People & Balances Page (`/people`)

This page serves as your contact book for Neondara and provides financial summaries.

- **Add/Edit/Delete People**:
    - Users can add new people with their name and an optional relation (e.g., Friend, Aunt, Uncle).
    - Each person card has a menu to "Edit" their details or "Delete" them. Deleting a person also deletes all associated transaction history and requires confirmation.
- **Net Balance Calculation**: For each person, the application automatically calculates and displays the net balance of all monetary gifts exchanged. The text and color change based on the balance:
    - **I have given more**: Green text.
    - **I have received more**: Red text.
    - **All square**: Neutral color.
- **View History**: A button on each person's card navigates to a detailed page showing only the transactions with that individual.

This page provides a focused view of your history with a single person.

- **Person Information**: Displays the person's name and relation.
- **Balance Summary**: Shows a clear summary of total money given, total money received, and the final net balance, along with summaries for sweets and gift counts.
- **Transaction History**: A complete timeline of every Neondara entry associated with that person.
- **Search History**: A search bar is located next to the "Transaction History" title, allowing users to search within that person's specific history by gift or notes. Matches are highlighted.

This page allows users to track shared expenses and manage who has paid their portion.
